# 3D_PhysicsGame

A larger game set in a 3D environment, meant to make use of 3D assets created by the students. Their implementation and use in Unity can be bound by the use of very simple animations in a physics-based game. 

Possible environments: Space, Underwater or inside an Anti-Gravity Secret Lab. 
Possible game-play keyword: racing, exploration, collectables, high-scores etc.

It involves player - environment interaction and it may make use of previously created features:
- character controls
- portals

Additional matters to consider:
- collisions & triggers
- animation control through script (or not)
- ...

The concept is under development :)
